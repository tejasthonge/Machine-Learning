''' 
Machine learning is the branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on 
developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data and improve 
from previous experience without being explicitly programmed for every task. 
In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by 
learning from the data.

#How machine learning algorithms work


'''Machine Learning works in the following manner.

A machine learning algorithm works by learning patterns and relationships from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task. Hereâ€™s a simplified overview of how a typical machine learning algorithm works:

1. Data Collection:
First, relevant data is collected or curated. This data could include examples, features, or attributes that are important for the task at hand, such as images, text, numerical data, etc.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Before feeding the data into the algorithm, it often needs to be preprocessed. This step may involve cleaning the data (handling missing values, outliers), transforming the data (normalization, scaling), and splitting it into training and test sets.

3. Choosing a Model:
Depending on the task (e.g., classification, regression, clustering), a suitable machine learning model is chosen. Examples include decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines, and more advanced models like deep learning architectures.

4. Training the Model:
The selected model is trained using the training data. During training, the algorithm learns patterns and relationships in the data. This involves adjusting model parameters iteratively to minimize the difference between predicted outputs and actual outputs (labels or targets) in the training data.

5. Evaluating the Model:
Once trained, the model is evaluated using the test data to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error are used to evaluate how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

6. Fine-tuning:
Models may be fine-tuned by adjusting hyperparameters (parameters that are not directly learned during training, like learning rate or number of hidden layers in a neural network) to improve performance.

7. Prediction or Inference:
Finally, the trained model is used to make predictions or decisions on new data. This process involves applying the learned patterns to new inputs to generate outputs, such as class labels in classification tasks or numerical values in regression tasks.
